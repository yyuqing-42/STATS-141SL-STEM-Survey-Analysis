Advisors(stats dept) are not familiar with staff that they should have been familiar with. 

2. They(stats dept) do not care about students enough, especially for those who are not stats major students. 

I had a horrible experience with stats advisors and they delayed my academic progress on stats minor for 2 quarters with both advisors' discrepancy and non-consistency with stats prerequisites classes. I heard many students had same experience of mine in terms of dealing their issues and questions in double or minor major with stats with advisors in stats dept. I even heard the manager of classes(I am not quite sure his title) said "" You'd better declare stats major ASAP, I don't want to see you again"" to a student which I think was pretty rude and discouraging. These words should not come from an educator or even a staff from a university. 

3. Maybe because UCLA has too many students that the class schedule is hard to accommodate all students. 

My sister is also a math and stats student graduating from UC Berkeley. Compared to her experience in UCB, I feel like UCB's registration system is more advanced than ours and UCB provides more flexibility to students to choose classes with their flexible prerequisite class requirement and cross-department classes enrollment. As long as you think you could handle it and the professor is willing to add you into the class, it's no problem to attend higher sequence classes regardless the prerequisite requirement or if it is cross-department/cross-major class which makes students have as many as possibilities to explore and succeed in their college life. 
I don't think UCLA cares about this, the staff just cares about killing the line outside their office and wants you to leave the office with no concern of whether your problem has been solved. 
To further illustrate, I would like to put my case as an example here, I took a stats10 in my community college which UCLA stats dept did not recognize it as equivalent to stats10 here and advisor A here insisted that I have to retake stat10 before taking stat20(where advisor B just manually enrolled my friend who had same situation as mine to a stat20 class, I knew this after the enrolling deadline, if not, I could have just gone to advisor B to have me added to stat20), but when I retook a stat10 here in UCLA, the registrar counted as a repetitive class so gave me zero credits of it. 
The problem exists for years without fixing and the consequence falls on students themselves including me. Because of this, I could not enroll into stat20 in 2018 fall which I should have been able to. In the later winter quarter I found out my stat10 enrollment had no credits so I dropped it with no stat20 provided in that quarter. Even then I went to stats dept, the advisor still did not care and asked me to come back next quarter when stat20 is available. In spring, I went back and the manager of classes did not solve the problem and asked me to consult with registrar why the registrar did not give credits for my stat10 here.  The staff in registrar thought it was wired that they could not do anything to a junior(at that time I was a junior) a repetitive class credits and for stats dept it was an small issue that they could just manually got around this issue and add me to stat20.  
Rather than a call to figure out this problem or even have a meeting to seriously discuss about this issue that many transfer students might have, they just let me went back and forth from the stats dept and Murphy Hall with both parties throwing their ball to the other. This was a very long story and here is just a small piece of it. After this, I felt exhausted and frustrated and do not want to make any contact with any admin staff here in UCLA. 
I have told this story to my sister who had same situation as mine that in her junior year she also needed to work with their stats dept on classes enrollment and double major declaration stuff, she never encountered any unhappiness with their dept over there in UCB and she thought it was unbelievable that our system was so rigid and inflexible because the only way for me to enroll stat20 is to 'beg' the stats dept staff to add me in as our system prevented me from enrolling higher sequence of classes which in UCB system, they won't prevent you from enrolling classes unless you acknowledge that you have full responsibility for your own academic progress and path. At that point, I was so regretful not choosing UCB over UCLA in 2018 as I got both admissions.",Average Value,46.9,66.7,33.3,56.3,75

I've also become very involved with UCLA Hillel and Jewish life on campus. Through this community, I've made so many friendships and connections that I know I will have for the rest of my life. I've grown as a student, a friend and a leader, and I can say with confidence that I wouldn't be doing as well as I am here if it weren't for this incredible community. ","As a STEM major, I sometimes feel that I'm not getting as much support from my professors and TA's as I deserve.  For example, I had a math professor for Linear Algebra who, in many ways, discouraged us from asking questions. When we did ask questions, he often provided a quick one word answer and didn't fully explain his thoughts. This experience made it harder for me to succeed in this class both because it decreased my confidence and because it made it harder for me to receive guidance and feedback. 

Though I've had several STEM professors who are very good, I am aware that STEM professors tend to exhibit this type of behavior more than non-STEM professors. I'm not exactly sure how UCLA could address this issue, but I think it is important for students of all majors to receive the support they deserve.  ",High Value,50,25,66.7,50,58.3

My home is about 1 hour away from UCLA, so I had the choice to commute and at first my parents wanted me to commute.

My brother and sister went to Cal Poly Pomona during their 4 years in college and it was only 15 minutes away from home so they commuted. They had a completely different experience there, and I think the difference was mainly because UCLA has a great culture and I was able to take advantage of this by living at UCLA. I was really able to focus on growing myself academically and socially. In terms of success emotionally, I don't know how I may have grown in that aspect.","The main thing that inhibited my ""success"" (or more like success in growth) at UCLA was always having to worry about my grades. I came into UCLA as a pre-med, and I knew that med schools looked at high GPAs very favorably over lower GPAs so I was always worried about my grades and thus I would just take classes to get the grade and not for the fun of learning. But starting mid-third year, I left the pre-med track and began exploring my own interests by taking classes I've always been interested in. I felt a lot happier since I don't worry about my GPA as much anymore, but I still feel like I can't learn just for the fun of it because there's always the pressure of getting a good grade in class.

This greatly helped me still be able to succeed academically during a time when I was struggling. 

The support of my parents has helped succeed in every way possible at UCLA. I have parents who support my mental health and my education. I am fortunate enough that they can also pay my full college tuition. They are a huge factor in my success here. 

Personal motivation has also been an important factor for success at UCLA. It is such a large campus community that it is easy to just feel like a number, sort of unimportant. One of the biggest things I learned was the need to self-advocate, to speak up for help and opportunities, and to actively participate in groups on campus. This has helped me feel like I belong at UCLA. ","Something specific that I feel has inhibited the success I wanted to have at UCLA has been trying to find undergraduate research experiences in the sciences. As a freshman, I applied to the biomedical research minor after earning an A in the preparatory course. I had a 3.9 GPA at the time. I was interviewed but was rejected. I applied twice more after this, and was still rejected. When I asked what could be done to improve my application, I was given generic answers. There was not really a clear explanation for my not getting accepted, despite limited lab space. After this, I struggled to find independent research opportunities with other professors. I tried cold emailing, and talking with professors in office hours. At one point in my junior year, I spoke to a professor about his lab and he said that he would rather accept freshmen because they have more years to spend in the lab, which would make training them worth it. I explained that I had wanted to start research as a freshmen but had struggled to find opportunities. I developed a great relationship with a professor who was not actively doing research, but who recommended me to several of his colleagues, but I was still not able to find an opportunity. I am now in my fourth year. I am disappointed, because I chose UCLA partly because of its reputation for incredible research. I even reached out to the chair of my major department, asking for feedback or advice on finding lab research opportunities, but was not told any information I did not already know or had not already tried. I just feel there was never an answer as to why I was not accepted into the minor, and since then, the challenge of finding a research opportunity has taken a toll on me. 

Personally, mental health issues have been a challenge for me throughout my life, and this continued into college and potentially negatively impacted my academics. However, I felt there were resources available to me that were helpful at UCLA.",High Value,46.9,25,50,81.3,58.3

Essentially most of the people I meet don't really have much in common with me from a background perspective so it's hard to feel like I belong when my life has been completely different from a social, economic, and ethnic-composition perspective. 
A lot of people generalize the ""premed"" process to be brutal and that you need a very well-rounded resume.  It has been really hard with all this pressure as a premed to do research, volunteering, extracurriculars for your resume to med school. I feel so burnt out already and I haven't even applied yet. I applied to several clubs as a sophomore and I got rejected from almost every single one. It's really hard to keep your thoughts positive when you aren't able to gain any experience in a field that is essentially mandatory for you resume.

I had a few acquaintances from classes, and that helped me not feel completely alone and in my opinion saved me from depression.

The answer to this problem was to just keep applying, but even then, a student can lose access to valuable resources some clubs tend to have. I think this furthers the notion that a student at a public university is on his/her own, and a result, fostering a more competitive environment. 

Academically, I was always frustrated with discussion and office hours. While some professors/classes put a great emphasis on helping their students, other classes have hundreds of students waiting 20 minutes to ask a professor or TA a question.

When I started at UCLA, I felt an immense pressure like never before to prove to my peers that I?d earned my spot alongside them. As cynical as it may sound to say so, I found that talking to others in class often left me feeling drained and inferior. Pressure for success and perfection is applied as heavily by classmates as parents, professors, and institutions. It?s my third year and I?m only barely feeling as though I have my head above water, and this is only after I?ve made the decision to live off-campus. Distance is what helped me succeed at UCLA; I found that the distractions on campus? whether they took the form of chaotic roommates or unrelentingly perfect classmates? were too much for my mental health. Moving off-campus, into a quiet neighborhood with my partner, has proven invaluable to my ability to succeed academically at UCLA. However, I?ve undoubtedly had to sacrifice my social life as a result of this distance? I?m no longer close (spatially) to my friends, which makes it nearly impossible to ever see each other since we?re all so busy with the demands of school and extracurriculars. 

Ultimately, a bit of separation from campus culture is what I needed to succeed. Academia, especially STEM at UCLA, invites a toxic culture of achievement, comparison, and perfection, that is tangible to all students? but we ignore it, even choosing to participate if it?ll give us an advantage. I need as much distance from that as is reasonably possible. ","I failed my first Chem quiz at UCLA. It was the very first quiz I ever took in college, and I got a 50%. I?d never received a score so low on anything, and I was crushed, turning to my floormates and classmates to complain? and hopefully seek encouragement. I was met with almost satisfied suggestions to drop the course, to change majors, to change life paths. ?This is going to be really, really difficult for you if you don?t even understand THAT.? ?Are you sure you want to be pre-med?? ?You know Chem?s only going to get harder.? Each person I spoke to smiled quietly at my (literal) failure, urging me to give up, convincing me that each test carried the weight of my entire future. I assumed I just had bad luck with floormates, so I started a group chat with a few classmates from my Chem class. One person texted and asked a basic conceptual question, to which another member replied ?I can?t answer that. My parents read my messages and will be upset with me if they see I?m helping the competition.? 

At this point, only a few weeks into my freshman year, the toxic culture of UCLA pre-meds was entirely tangible? in fact, it had slapped me in the face. I was dejected. I felt like every person around me saw me as competition, rather than a classmate or peer that they could learn from (and vice versa). The environment that has been cultivated at UCLA, specifically in the STEM department, is absolutely crushing? and no one?s allowed to acknowledge that. If you acknowledge that this is hard, then you?ve lost. It often feels as though the expectation at UCLA is to be perfect, to never fail, to never blink an eye at the overwhelming expectations of classes and extracurriculars? because we?re Bruins, we?re the #1 public university. 

As someone with mental health issues, I?ve often found it detrimental to rise to the occasion. In order to do all that is expected of me, I have to sacrifice my social life, my personality, sleep, eating? school has to be my #1 priority at all times. Lack of routine, especially sleep and meal times, has destabilized my mental health every single quarter. I?m exhausted, and I can?t turn to my peers, because we?re all just supposed to pretend we?re doing fine. The intersection of the toxicity of campus culture and my own personal mental health issues often leaves me feeling at a disadvantage compared to other students (especially when you account for the lack of availability of sufficient psychological and psychiatric care from the University).",High Value,18.8,16.7,69.4,50,66.7

Moreover, at night, the bus has some strange people. One time, I stayed on campus for a club social until 10 pm. When I got on the bus to go back to my apartment, a man sat next to me and asked me questions on where I lived. He tried to lean his head on my shoulder and it made me very uncomfortable.
