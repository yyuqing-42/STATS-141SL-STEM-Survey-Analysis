For example, I had some health issues last year and one of my friends approached me and said she'd been dealing with similar issues. The issues were affecting me both academically and emotionally, and her support really helped me get through it. 

I've also become very involved with UCLA Hillel and Jewish life on campus. Through this community, I've made so many friendships and connections that I know I will have for the rest of my life. I've grown as a student, a friend and a leader, and I can say with confidence that I wouldn't be doing as well as I am here if it weren't for this incredible community. ","As a STEM major, I sometimes feel that I'm not getting as much support from my professors and TA's as I deserve.  For example, I had a math professor for Linear Algebra who, in many ways, discouraged us from asking questions. When we did ask questions, he often provided a quick one word answer and didn't fully explain his thoughts. This experience made it harder for me to succeed in this class both because it decreased my confidence and because it made it harder for me to receive guidance and feedback. 

Though I've had several STEM professors who are very good, I am aware that STEM professors tend to exhibit this type of behavior more than non-STEM professors. I'm not exactly sure how UCLA could address this issue, but I think it is important for students of all majors to receive the support they deserve.  ",High Value,50,25,66.7,50,58.3

Having a strong diverse community of ambitious and empathetic people in my network has probably been the strongest guiding force in helping me grow as an individual, team member and a leader in college.

4. General Education","1. Exclusivity : The exclusive nature of certain campus groups can sometimes be an impediment in the way of more equitable extension of opportunities. 
2. Poor lecturing : I have strongly disliked over 4 classes at UCLA (with most of them being in the Stats department). Instructors that fail to communicate the core concepts make the class experience an absolutely dreadful one. It is really hard to sit through theoretical classes with professors that lack essential communication skills, and as much as I respect and value the role of a professor, it nevertheless makes it a frsutrating experience.

Many STEM major students have a generalization of being quiet and not extremely willing to talk, which makes it difficult sometimes to form study groups.","Being part of a transfer floor and getting to know each other over the struggles we made to get here and finding a club that I can associate myself with helped me feel like I belong here. However, the INTENSE competition within STEM classes makes me feel less like I belong here, because of being on the average range of the spectrum of STEM students (not great grades, but not bad ones either; between a B- and C+ range; even though I get an average A in a GE class), ALMOST feeling like I am out of UCLAs STEM major league","With the issue of STEM major students being generally quiet and since there is a need in the “real world” to collaborate on teams more often, there should be AT LEAST 5-10 minutes spent each class for people to work IN GROUPS (assigned or self-forming) to inspire cooperation instead of competition between UCLA STEM major students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally the STEM field is mostly white and Asian. There is a stigma of not being competent enough to join their study groups. Transfers are also typically shunned as well. This makes it very difficult to do well because the study groups helps students do well enough to maintain a certain grade, which raises the curve. Those students not in the study groups are at a significant disadvantage because they are testing against those study groups.","Transfers are not cared for like UCLA makes it seem before transferring here. Transfer student orientation is a rushed event that forces students to take unnecessary courses and confuses many transfers. Professors, students, and even counselors have made negative remarks regarding me being a transfer student. The only people who care for transfers are other transfers.","Lessen the weight of exams on grading schemes and teach TAs (and even professors) how to explain topics in an understandable manner. Although professors are hired to do research, it does not give them an excuse to be bad lecturers. UCLA should be more inclined to hire professors who can perform both tasks well.

- Less competition (curved-straight scale is fine, but curved scale pushes people away from each other, and drives students to isolate themselves in fear of helping someone that may do better than them)

-More appreciation of mental health (professors do not really care about anything outside their classes, unless it's a near death experience and do not realize it may be some of their classes that causes this madness)

The parents expect six-figure salaries early in your career and they see any non-stem field as useless. Some anxiety issues have also complicated my concentration and study habits. ","When trying to form study groups with peers in my stem (specifically math/stats classes), if a second goes by where I'm not 100% proactive and investing time in the other person while they aren't being fully diligent either, they pretty much drop you. The elitism here is really cumbersome, and my grades have suffered at times due to unsuccessful efforts in creating a lasting, effective study group. It just feels like you're being used simply for a grade, and once the class is over, that's that. They don't want to be your friend or make any outside effort to connect. ","Back when I was deciding between colleges, UCSD was my other top choice. Admitted as a CS major, one thing I noticed was that their CS department is huge on having tutoring hours for all their CS classes, and fostering more student collaboration. This is valuable for gaining teamwork experience and students can only benefit from this by participating. TA and professor hours can be intimidating and crowded, so creating a strong, collaborative tutoring system would be great. Nobody there was cut-throat competitive or worried that helping someone else would ""bring down the curve and thus disadvantage me.""
